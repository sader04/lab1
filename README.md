# lab1

Feedback:
- You are limiting the possibilities of your code as you list the apps to search for, use a query term rather than app id.

- Use continuation tokens in reviews so you can get as much data as possible. Remember, more data, richer analyses in downstream tasks

- It’s good to separate layers’ logic in code files. Kudos on that.

- Think about writing with **append** in the loop for retrieving reviews with pagination; it is always better to prevent data loss if code crashes

- Please add a screenshot of your dashboard to the readmefile
